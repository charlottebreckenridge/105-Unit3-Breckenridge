# Public Health Data Repository Exploration 
This is a publicly accesible instructional manual on a collection of national public health data. By exploring the following files, anyone can learn how to reproduce datasets for future scientific analysis of national health statistics. This was produced by a research assistant at Society for Science, 501 non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of science through education programs and publications. 

The Several files contained below include the following:

  - One contains is a CSV file containing public health data by U.S county 
  - Four are python notebooks with instructional material on how to get started manipulating and examining the data
  - three are subsets of data points gathered using Python to target more specific material from the original raw data
  
 # Purpose
The purpose of this repository project is to demonstrate how we might refine data by capturing subsets using the pandas program. For this particular research project, we are working with data titled "CountyHealthData_2014-2015" as our source for analysis. Using that CSV file as our raw data, we can cull refined sets of targeted information to hypothesize potential connections between the material. 

The source we are working with is a nationally compiled data set with information rangining broadly from "Median Household Income" to "Homicide Rates".

Using "CountyHealthData_2014-2015", those interested in examining issues regarding health policy might be able to gather essential research on locations in the U.S in need of reform or support. It could also provide those doing social justice research of any sort with valuable insight on the struggles of those within certain geographical locaitons within the U.S. 

# Visualization
Using subsets gleaned from the overarching Public Health dataset, researchers might also care to capture data visualizations such as the one below. These visualizations can help articulate layered information in a concise and understandabe way. The information presented below connects the rate of violent crime in a sample of Floridian Counties to their median household incomes.

As you can see, the scatterplot and trendline visual demonstrate how counties with lower median household incomes associate with higher rates of violent crime. 

# Getting Started 
Initially, users will need to have Anaconda Navigator installed on their device. Here is a link to do that [Anaconda Download](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

To get started manipulating the data, head first to the file here for instruction on how to start using Pandas - [Pandas How To](https://github.com/charlottebreckenridge/105-Unit3-Breckenridge/blob/main/Using%20Pandas1.ipynb)

For further instruction on Pandas, follow the link here - [Pandas How To (part 2)](https://github.com/charlottebreckenridge/105-Unit3-Breckenridge/blob/main/Using%20Pandas2.ipynb)

Finally, here is where you can find instruction on how to manipulate the County Public Health Data set we are working with - [Process Documentaion](https://github.com/charlottebreckenridge/105-Unit3-Breckenridge/blob/main/Process%20Documentation.ipynb)
