# 105-Unit3-Breckenridge
This a public data repository completed for professor Gotzler's English 105 course at the Universtiy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
It containes three files :
  - One contains is a CSV file containing public health data by U.S county 
  - One is a python notebook with instructional material and methods used to examine the data
  - One is a subset of data points for a more pointed analysis 
 
The purpose of this repository project is to demonstrate to users how we might analyze and capture insight from working with publicly available data sets. For my own data research, I chose to work with Professor Gotzler's suggested data titled "CountyHealthData_2014-2015" as my source for analysis. Using that CSV file as my raw data, I attempt to cull refined sets of targeted information to hypothesize potential connections between the material.
