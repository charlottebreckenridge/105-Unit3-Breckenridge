# 105-Unit3-Breckenridge

This a public data repository completed for professor Gotzler's English 105 course at the Universtiy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
It containes several files :

  - One contains is a CSV file containing public health data by U.S county 
  - Four are python notebooks with instructional material on how to get started manipulating and examining the data
  - Two are subsets of data points gathered using Python to target more specific material from the original raw data
 
The purpose of this repository project is to demonstrate to users how we might analyze and capture insight from working with publicly available data sets. For my own data research, I chose to work with Professor Gotzler's suggested data titled "CountyHealthData_2014-2015" as my source for analysis. Using that CSV file as my raw data, I attempt to cull refined sets of targeted information to hypothesize potential connections between the material. 

The source we are working with is a nationally compiled data set with information rangining broadly from "Median Household Income" to "Homicide Rates"

Using "CountyHealthData_2014-2015", those interested in examining issues regarding health policy might be able to gather essential research on locations in the U.S in need of reform or support. It could also provide those doing social justice research of any sort with valuable insight on the struggles of those within certain geographical locaitons within the U.S.
